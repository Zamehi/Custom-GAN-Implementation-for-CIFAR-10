# Custom-GAN-Implementation-for-CIFAR-10
You need to use CIFAR-10 dataset to train a custom GAN network. In this network, the generator will be the same as discussed in the class, however, instead of using discriminator to just distinguish between fake and real, you need to create a custom neural network that finds similarity between two images i.e. you pass a generated image and a real image together to the discriminator network. This will generate a similarity score. Now, the objective of GAN is still the same, discriminator will try to maximize the distance (dissimilarity) between the generated and real images while generator will want to minimize this score (as it wants to generate a similar image to that of a real one). For this question you can limit your classes to only cats, and dogs.
